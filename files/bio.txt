I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Unversity of Nebraska Omaha (UNO). My research focuses on machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, specifically image category, multimodal learning, and medical image analysis. I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Kentucky[https://www.uky.edu]. I am a member of Multimodal Vision Research Laboratory (MVRL, https://mvrl.cse.wustl.edu/) supervised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs(https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Nathan-Jacobs.html) and a member of Lin Brain Lab (https://linbrain.com/) supervised by Dr. Ai-Ling Lin. 

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Shandong University, China, and my Master’s degree from Universität Stuttgart, Germany. During my undergraduate study, I attended Xi’an Jiaotong University as an exchange student for one year.
